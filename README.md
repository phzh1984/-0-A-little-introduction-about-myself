- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Leo. Thank you for reading my GitHub. 

- I enjoy the process of data collection, cleaning, integration, modeling, and visualization, which helps me analyze data to uncover valuable insights. This involves identifying trends, patterns, and correlations within datasets, contributing to informed decision-making.

- I also enjoy using programming languages like Python, Julia, and R for data preprocessing and exploratory data analysis.  I utilize various machine learning, deep learning algorithms, and statistical testing methods for modeling analysis. I enjoy conducting algorithm model optimization, selecting parameters, evaluating models, and predicting data classifications. I enjoy implementing and evaluating machine learning and deep learning algorithms for classification, regression, and clustering tasks.

- During my spare time, I like to interact with my neighbors and friends, organizing some activities to strengthen relationships among community members. Through mutual help, we contribute to making our community better and better.

- I also enjoy physical exercise. I like playing table tennis and hiking which contributes to my physical health and helps me maintain mental focus.
