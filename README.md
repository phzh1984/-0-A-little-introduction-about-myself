- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Leo. Thank you for reading my GitHub. 

- I enjoy the process of data collection, cleaning, integration, modeling, and visualization, which helps me analyze data to uncover valuable insights. This involves tasks such as identifying trends, patterns, and correlations within datasets, contributing to informed decision-making.

- I also enjoy using programming languages like R, Julia, and Python for data preprocessing and exploratory data analysis.  I utilize various machine learning algorithms and statistical testing methods for modeling analysis. I find pleasure in conducting algorithm model optimization, selecting parameters, evaluating models, and predicting data classifications. I enjoy implementing and evaluating machine learning algorithms for tasks like classification, regression, and clustering.

- During my spare time, I like to interact with my neighbors and friends, organizing some activities to strengthen relationships among community members. Through mutual help, we contribute to making our community better and better. I also enjoy physical exercise. I like playing table tennis and hiking which contributes to my physical health and helps me maintain mental focus.
